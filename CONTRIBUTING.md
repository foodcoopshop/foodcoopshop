If you want to contribute **a small change** (eg. typo) that's how it works:

* [Fork the project and make a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)
* Please follow the coding conventions (see below) and enjoy supporting a great project!

## You plan to contribute more often
If you plan to **collaborate more intensively**, please ask Mario (office@foodcoopshop.com) for an ivitation to the foodcoopshop-team. After accepting the invitation, the workflow for contributions is the following:

* Create a new branch within the [main foodcoopshop repository](https://github.com/foodcoopshop/foodcoopshop)
* Using [git flow](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) (or at least their naming conventions) appreciated
* the name of the new feature branch should start with "issue-" and the issue number, followed by an optional short description of the issue
* an example for a feature branch name would be "feature/issue-9-i18n"
* make your changes, push, and make a pull request to the develop branch
* Please follow the coding conventions (see below) and enjoy supporting a great project!
